To make pizza, you need to take a lump of ${userInputs[3]} and make a thin, round ${userInputs[4]} ${userInputs[5]}.
Then you cover it with ${userInputs[6]} sauce, ${userInputs[7]} cheese, and fresh chopped ${userInputs[8]}. 
Next you have to bake it in a very hot ${userInputs[9]}. When it is done, cut it into ${userInputs[10]} ${userInputs[11]}.
Some kids like ${userInputs[12]} pizza the best, but my favorite is the ${userInputs[13]} pizza.
If I could, I would eat pizza ${userInputs[14]} times a day!`
