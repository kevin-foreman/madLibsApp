const originalStory = `Pizza was invented by a 'adjective' ${userInputs[0]} 'nationality' ${userInputs[1]} chef named 'person' ${userInputs[2]}. 
To make pizza, you need to take a lump of 'noun' ${userInputs[2]} and make a thin, round 'adjective' ${userInputs[3]} 'noun' ${userInputs[4]}. Then you cover it with 'adjective' ${userInputs[5]} 
sauce, 'adjective' ${userInputs[6]} cheese, and fresh chopped 'adjective' ${userInputs[7]}. 
Next you have to bake it in a very hot 'noun' ${userInputs[8]}. When it is done, cut it into 'number' ${userInputs[9]} 'shapes' ${userInputs[10]}.
Some kids like 'food' ${userInputs[11]} pizza the best, but my favorite is the 'food' ${userInputs[12]} pizza.
If I could, I would eat pizza 'number' ${userInputs[12]} times a day!`
